  <p>The ‘Fertiliser Association of New Zealand Econometric Model’ (Econometric model) allows farmers and fertiliser company advisors to visualise the potential response to fertiliser nutrients (P, K, RPR and Lime/acidity). The model allows the medium and long-term response to different fertiliser policies to be quantified in economic terms and builds an understanding of economic optimum vs biological.</p>
  <p>The tool estimates: the value of maintenance fertiliser nutrient applications; the potential within a farm system to increase fertility and production and the potential saving from reducing fertiliser inputs in some situations. In addition, the model can be used to evaluate the impact that changes to nutrient prices could have on recommendations for soil fertility management.</p>
<p>The Econometric model is used to show the impact of different fertiliser nutrient application rates, it does not make recommendations on the selection of fertiliser products. The model is specific to only pasture-based systems, and covers Phosphorus by default. Optional considerations include Potassium, Sulphur, RPR and Lime. </p>
  <p>Originally the model relied on input data imported from Overseer Nutrient Budgets and was provided with a desktop UI as an exe file. It has now been moved into the cloud where it is accessed via an API. There is the ability to enter data with or without an Overseer output report. An external tool is required to collate the farm inputs into a JSON file which is then passed to the API with the requested scenario.</p>
